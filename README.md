### Creating a Flow
1. **Add Nodes**: Use the side panel to add new nodes
2. **Connect Nodes**: Drag from node handles to create connections
3. **Edit Content**: Click on nodes to edit message content
4. **Position Nodes**: Drag nodes to arrange your flow layout

### Managing Your Flow
- **Save**: Use Ctrl+S or the save button to validate your flow
- **Export**: Download your flow as JSON for backup or sharing
- **Import**: Load previously saved flows from JSON files
- **Delete**: Select nodes/edges and use the delete button

### Flow Validation Rules
- Only one node should have no outgoing connections (exit point)
- All other nodes must have at least one outgoing connection
- Flows with multiple exit points cannot be saved
